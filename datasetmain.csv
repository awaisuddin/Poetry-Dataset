All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.

“I grew up in a scientific world, the son of a neurosurgeon.” – Eben Alexander
“There are more important ways of earning a living, aren’t there? Like being a neurosurgeon. But some plays are very important, aren’t they?” – Michael Gambon
“The neurosurgeon removed the right half of my skull. The swelling from the injury was so severe, it was causing enormous pressure on my brain, which if left uncontrolled would have killed me.” – Amy Rankin
“Where did the boy genius go? He had been, as a child, expected to be a neurosurgeon, or a great novelist. And now he’s considering (or, okay, refusing to consider) law school. Was the burden of his potential too much for him?” – Michael Cunningham
“What had I expected of the first child? Everything. Rocket scientist. Neurosurgeon. Designated hitter. We talked wisely at cocktail parties about the sad mistake our mothers had made in pinning all their hopes and dreams on us. We were full of it.” – Anna Quindlen
“Tell the truth. If you tell the truth all the time you don’t have to worry three months down the line about what you said three months earlier. Truth is always the truth. You won’t have to complicate your life by trying to cover up.” – Benjamin Carson
“The brain is the organ of destiny. It holds within its humming mechanism secrets that will determine the future of the human race.” – Wilder Penfield
“I had this fantasy of becoming a neurosurgeon. You know, the normal Jewish boy fantasy, but I wanted to be a neurosurgeon for some reason. So I started in this unpleasant way. I was an assistant to the coroner, opening up corpses, taking the innards out, opening skulls, taking the brains out.” – Joseph Brodsky
“Successful people don’t have fewer problems. They have determined that nothing will stop them from going forward.” – Benjamin Carson
“[Doctor Strange] is still quite cocky by the end of the film. No, I’d say the major curve for him is that he learns that it’s not all about him, that there’s a greater good. But what he thinks he was doing as a neurosurgeon, that was good because it benefitted people’s health was really just a furtherment of his attempts to control death and control his own fate and other people’s, but that’s still driven by ego.” – Benedict Cumberbatch
“I don’t know where the idea originated that memoir writing is cathartic. For me, it’s always felt like playing my own neurosurgeon, sans anesthesia. As a memoirist, you have to crack your head open and examine every uncomfortable thing in there.” – Koren Zailckas
“Do you want to do this thing? Sit down and do it. Are you not writing? Keep sitting there. Does it not feel right? Keep sitting there. Think of yourself as a monk walking the path to enlightenment. Think of yourself as a high school senior wanting to be a neurosurgeon. Is it possible? Yes. Is there some shortcut? Not one I’ve found. Writing is a miserable, awful business. Stay with it. It is better than anything in the world.” – Ann Patchett
“Here is the treasure chest of the world – the public library, or a bookstore.” – Benjamin Carson
“I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don’t I talk about race that often. I said it’s because I’m a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say – I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I’m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn’t make them who they are.” – Benjamin Carson
“If we would spend half the amount of money that we currently lavish on sports and entertainment, we could provide complete and free education for every student in this country.” – Benjamin Carson
“It’s one of the things that attracted me to the role [Doctor Strange] is the fact that it’s a really widely origin story, I mean this is part of it, but of course there’s the whole chapter before where he’s the neurosurgeon who has the accident. It’s fantastic.” – Benedict Cumberbatch
“I’d written Smashed not because I was ambitious and not because writing down my feelings was cathartic (it felt more like playing one’s own neurosurgeon sans anesthesia). No. I’d made a habit–and eventually a profession–of memoir because I hail from one of those families where shows of emotions are discouraged.” – Koren Zailckas
“I don’t know where the idea originated that memoir writing is cathartic. For me, it’s always felt like playing my own neurosurgeon, sans anesthesia. As a memoirist, you have to crack your head open and examine every uncomfortable thing in there.” – Koren Zailckas
“As a pediatric neurosurgeon, I frequently faced life and death situations, and had to come up with the right diagnosis, the right plan, and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.” – Benjamin Carson
“I was talking to my dad, who’s a neurosurgeon. He had this academic paper he wanted to publish. Journals take about 18 months to publish a paper, and he just wanted to get things up there.” – Trip Adler
“Neurosurgery seemed to present the most challenging and direct confrontation with meaning, identity, and death.” – Paul Kalanithi
“Economics is not brain surgery.” – Benjamin Carson
“God has given to every one of us more than fourteen billion cells and connections in our brain. Now why would God give us such a complex organ system unless He expects us to use it?” – Benjamin Carson
“Mr. President, how long must women wait to get their liberty? Let us have the rights we deserve.” – Alice Paul
“If you act like you know what you’re going, you can do anything you want – except neurosurgery.” – Sharon Stone
“I think Dr. Ben Carson is a unique political personality. He’s what we call a conviction politician. He actually believes in what he says. Here’s a fellow who had been a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins for over 30 years. Babies conjoined at the head, he is the one that did that. He’s a superstar. Ben Carson steps away from medicine, looks at the political environment around him, and he is aghast at what he sees.” – Daniel Henninger
“When one practices discipline and moves from the beginner’s territory to immovable wisdom, one makes a return and falls back to the level of the beginner.” – Takuan Soho   
“Zen is to have the heart and soul of a little child.” – Takuan Soho 
“Sever the edge between before and after.” – Takuan Soho   
“It is the very mind itself that leads the mind astray – of the mind, do not be mindless.” – Takuan Soho  
“When this No-Mind has been well developed, the mind does not stop with one thing nor does it lack any one thing. It appears appropriately when facing a time of need.” – Takuan Soho
“One does not divide this by impressions or knowledge. What this means is that no matter how much you try to figure or calculate by means of impressions or knowledge, it will not prove the least bit useful. Therefore, separate yourself from the discrimination of figuring things out.” – Takuan Soho 
“The Buddha and all sentient beings are not two.” – Takuan Soho 
“The Right Mind is the mind that does not remain in one place. It is the mind that stretches throughout the entire body and self.  The Confused Mind is the mind that, thinking something over, congeals in one place.” – Takuan Soho
“Not stopping the mind is object and essence.  Put nowhere, it will be everywhere.  Even in moving the mind outside the body, if it is sent in one direction, it will be lacking in nine others.  If the mind is not restricted to just one direction, it will be in all ten.” – Takuan Soho
“The mind that becomes fixed and stops in one place does not function freely.  Similarly, the wheels of a cart go around because they are not rigidly in place.  If they were to stick tight, they would not go around.  The mind is also something that does not function if it becomes attached to a single situation.” – Takuan Soho
“Shonin: I have composed a poem. Kokushi: Let’s hear it. Shonin: When I chant, Both Buddha and self Cease to exist. There is only the voice that says, Namu Amida Butsu. Kokushi: Something’s wrong with the last couple of lines, don’t you think? (after a lapse of time) Shonin: This is how I’ve written it: When I chant, Both Buddha and self Cease to exist. Namu Amida Butsu. Kokushi: There! You got it!” – Takuan Soho
“Although it does not mindfully keep guard, In the small mountain fields the scarecrow does not stand in vain.” – Takuan Soho
“One may explain water, but the mouth will not become wet. One may expound fully on the nature of fire, but the mouth will not become hot.” – Takuan Soho
“If you would know a man’s good and evil points, you should know the underlings and retainers he loves and employs, and the friends with whom he mixes intimately. If the lord is not correct, none of his friends and retainers will be correct.” – Takuan Soho
“If the mind congeals in one place and remains with one thing, it is like frozen water and is unable to be used freely: ice that can wash neither hands nor feet. When the mind is melted and is used like water, extending throughout the body, it can be sent wherever one wants to send it.” – Takuan Soho
“When facing a single tree, if you look at a single one of its red leaves, you will not see all the others. When the eye is not set on one leaf, and you face the tree with nothing at all in mind, any number of leaves are visible to the eye without limit. But if a single leaf holds the eye, it will be as if the remaining leaves were not there.” – Takuan Soho
“If you follow the present-day world, you will turn your back on the Way; if you would not turn your back on the Way, do not follow the world.” – Takuan Soho
“The mind must always be in the state of flowing; for when it stops anywhere that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of swordsmen, it means death.” – Takuan Soho
“When a person does not think, ‘Where shall I put it?’ the mind will extend throughout the entire body and move to any place at all. . . . The effort not to stop the mind in just one place – this is discipline. Not stopping the mind is object and essence. Put it nowhere and it will be everywhere. Even in moving the mind outside the body, if it is sent in one direction, it will be lacking in nine others. If the mind is not restricted to just one direction, it will be in all ten.” – Takuan Soho
“There is no light for those who don’t know darkness.” – Takuan Soho
“Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won’t see the tree,
“One is not likely to achieve understanding from the explanation of another.” – Takuan Soho
“The unfettered mind: Writings of the Zen master to the sword master.” – Takuan Soho
“Presumably, as a Martial artist, I do not fight for gain or loss, am not concerned with strength or weakness, and neither advance a step nor retreat a step. The enemy does not see me. I do not see the enemy. Penetrating to a place where heaven and earth have not yet divided, where yin and yang have not yet arrived, I quickly and necessarily gain effect.” – Takuan Soho
“Consider the core of the mind to be a wagon, with will-power to be carried about in it. Push it to a place where there can be a failure, and there will be a failure. Push it to a place where there can be a success, and there will be a success. But whether there is success or failure, if one entrusts himself to the straightness of this wagon of the core of the mind, he will attain right-mindedness in either case. Severing oneself from desire and being like a rock or tree, nothing will ever be achieved. Not departing from desire, but realizing a desire-less right-mindedness – this is the way.” – Takuan Soho
“When you look at a tree, see it for its leaves, its branches, its trunk, and the roots, then and only then will you see the tree.” – Takuan Soho
“Each action of the warrior is performed from a place of fundamental wisdom. It is completely different from the ordinary behavior of a fool. Even if it looks the same, it is different on the inside.” – Takuan Soho
“Completely forget about the mind and you will do all things well.” – Takuan Soho
“Make it a secret principle in either seeing or hearing not to detain the mind in one place.” – Takuan Soho
“In the case of the swordsman, it means death.  When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy’s sword movements.  He just stands there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man’s subconscious that strikes.” – Takuan Soho
“It felt at that moment unarguable that a horizon line might exert as potent or pull upon the mind as a mountain’s summit.” – Robert Macfarlane
“I text nonstop, and I love emoji. I’m also on the phone quite a bit for work – probably more than 10 calls per day.” – Evan Spiegel
“No one calls anymore, they just text. It’s way easier.” – Kai Michaels
“When we agree to meet with friends, have drinks, dinner, and watch a movie on a Friday evening, we incur coordination costs. All the emails, text messages, and phone calls that are required to arrange a social evening are the coordination costs.” – David J. Anderson
“He has a frightening aversion to text messaging in general. It’s a phone. It’s for making calls, not for writing novels.” – Patrick Carman
“Thank you to my family, my fans and fans of other teams for their support. The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players. God Bless everyone and thank u so much.” – Adrian Peterson
“Phone calls are much more personal than texting and then when you get a girl on the phone, it’s like you ask a question and you get a response back. For a text message, they can read it and get back to it whenever they want to. So that makes a difference, almost like a power play in a way.” – Michael B. Jordan
“A lot of times people will say, ‘Well, gosh, you’re really good; you should try acting!’ And I say, ‘Come on! I’m thesping my little guts out over here.” – Jim Cummings
“Jelani hasn’t stopped calling and text messaging me since Thursday. Every day there has been more than twenty calls, a dozen voicemails, damn near hundreds of text messages, and only God knows how many times he IM’d me because I haven’t logged in out of fear.” – Jessica N. Watkins
“For my daughter I would suffer through a thousand divorces, a million uncomfortable phone calls, a trillion emotionally fraught text messages.” – Jeffrey Zeldman
“The Olympics will be great for the growth of golf on a global scale, but my focus right now is on being the best player I can be, trying to win Major Championships and contributing to what will hopefully be a victorious European side at the forthcoming Ryder Cup Matches against the USA.” – Rory McIlroy
“I think that Ionesco’s greatest weapon is that he’s able to make us laugh at the darkest corners of our souls.” – Geoffrey Rush
“At the end of the day, I’m very convinced that you’re going to be judged on how you are as a husband and as a father and not on how many bowl games we won.” – Urban Meyer
“Birthing is the most profound initiation to spirituality a woman can have.” – Robin Lim
“These ‘free’ applications ask for permission to read your emails, your text messages, listen to your phone calls, record video from your phone. Why else would someone spend millions developing an application which they then give away? Kind-hearted, maybe? Get real.” – John McAfee
“He thought of his wife, of his son, of his youth. He thought of life. He thought of death and then he thought of life again.” – Teodor Flonta
“The more I took note of how my body and brain clicked along through the day, the more I realized that I spent a considerable amount of time banging around with a brain full of chatter; a rush of things to do, bills to pay, telephone calls, text messages, e-mails, worrying about my job or my looks, my boobs or my ass; I rushed from thing to thing, multitasking, triple-timing, hoping to cover all the bases, avoiding anything that might disrupt the schedule or routine. At times, I was so caught up in the tempo and pattern, the predictable tap, tap, tap of each day, that there was no time to notice the neighbors had moved out, the wind was sneaking in from the north, the sun was shifting on its axis, and tonight the moon would look like the milky residue floating inside an enormous cereal bowl. I wondered when I had become a person who noticed so little.” – Dee Williams
“You know what makes me happy? Unexpected phone calls in the middle of the day. Remembering what I liked at that one restaurant we went to that one time. Half-dead grocery store flowers just because they were on sale. A good morning text that says, ‘have a good day and try not to burn anything to the ground in a furious rage.” – Samantha Irby
“It’s a wonder that any mother ever called a daughter Dinah again. But some did. Maybe you guessed that there was more to me than the voiceless cipher in the text. Maybe you heard it in the music of my name: the first vowel high and clear, as when a mother calls to her child at dusk; the second sounds soft, for whispering secrets on pillows. Dee-nah.” – Anita Diamant
“These ‘free’ applications ask for permission to read your emails, your text messages, listen to your phone calls, record video from your phone. Why else would someone spend millions developing an application which they then give away? Kind-hearted, maybe? Get real.” – John McAfee
“And then practice this hermeneutic of adoration in the reading of Holy Scripture. Plan on spending the rest of our lives exploring and enjoying the world both vast and intricate that is revealed by this text.” – Eugene H. Peterson
“No Text, No Replies. No Calls, No Chats. But I’m still here waiting for you.”
“Current Situation is No Text, No Calls, No Meet… Still Now With… HOPE.” 
“Once I always put my phone under silence. One or the other called me and we used to talk hours late-night, something good or shit. Now, I keep staring at my phone with its volume raised to the maximum. No call, No Text Messages, No Whatsapp Calls, Not even a customer care call do I receive.”
“And I realized, people started to move and I am here stagnant, tagging them in MEMES.”
“No Text No Calls. Nothing is worth losing a life.”
“People make time for who they want to make time for. People text, call and reply to people they want to talk to. Never believe anyone who says they’re too busy. If they wanted to be around you, they would.”
“No one is too busy for anything. If someone wants to be in your life they will make an effort, not make up excuses. We all respond to people according to their importance on your priority list.”
“I stopped calling because you’re always too busy, stopped texting because it took our hours to reply and wanted to give you a chance to miss me. It’s been a month with no contact.”
“A person being “too busy” is a myth. People make time for the things that are really important to them!”
“I’ll check my phone 100 times a day waiting for a message from someone who waits 5 hours to reply to mine. I’m no one’s second choice. If you’re too busy to reply I’m gonna stop trying & stop texting.”
“The bricoleur, says Levi-Strauss, is someone who uses ‘the means at hand,’ that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary, or to try several of them at once, even if their form and their origin are heterogenous – and so forth. There is therefore a critique of language in the form of bricolage, and it has even been said that bricolage is a critical language itself … If one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one’s concepts from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is bricoleur.” – Jacques Derrida
“Teenagers would rather text than talk. They feel calls would reveal too much.” – Sherry Turkle
“Thank you to my family, my fans and fans of other teams for their support. The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players. God Bless everyone and thank u so much.” – Adrian Peterson

“You can trust your dog to guard your house but never trust your dog to guard your sandwich.” – Unknown
“A text message can lead to a date, which can lead to a kiss, and a wonderful night together. Will you text me?” – Unknown
“It’s a phone. It’s for making calls, not for writing novels.” – Patrick Carman
“We face two overlapping challenges. The first concerns real-time court-ordered interception of what we call ‘data in motion,’ such as phone calls, e-mail, and live chat sessions. The second challenge concerns court-ordered access to data stored on our devices, such as e-mail, text messages, photos, and videos – or what we call ‘data at rest.” – James Comey
“According to the three missed calls from her mother – who thought Madison had been kidnapped in the big, bad city and was now being held for an ungodly sum of money – the four text messages from her brother wondering if she knew how to navigate the beltway – because apparently little sisters couldn’t drive – and the voice mail from her father warning there was a problem with the reservations, she was late for brunch.” – J. Lynn
“Our amended Constitution is the lodestar for our aspirations. Like every text worth reading, it is not crystalline. The phrasing is broad and the limitations of its provisions are not clearly marked. Its majestic generalities and ennobling pronouncements are both luminous and obscure. This ambiguity of course calls forth interpretation, the interaction of reader and text. The encounter with the Constitutional text has been, in many senses, my life’s work.” – William J. Brennan
“The dots had begun to connect. It wouldn’t take long for the police to connect me to purchasing the phone that Chance had been using. It wouldn’t take long for them to retrieve the text messages and hundreds of phone calls between me and “Reginald Barner”. I didn’t know how they had connected the dots, but they were connected. It was time for me to run before they fully connected to me.” – Jessica N. Watkins
“I hate it when people text “Call me.” I’m going to start calling people and as soon as they answer I’ll say “text me,” then hang up.” – Unknown
“Conflicts are fueled by the tendency of the powerful to exploit the power and the anger and frustration of the powerless, which turns into violence. International Solidarity Movement activists are attempting to confront the exploitation of power and to bring back hope to the powerless.” – Ghassan Andoni
“My students – all adults – bring a lot of writing skill to the first class, and they and I get better as the class progresses.” – James Thayer
“Never forget to be yourself, and never forget the purpose of your life.” – Debasish Mridha
“It is a simple fact that all of us use the techniques of acting to achieve whatever ends we seek.” – Marlon Brando
“You were afraid this might be the case. Your dad has blocked the front door with the refrigerator. Looks like he’s taking the grounding seriously this time.” – Andrew Hussie
“This is exactly why babies should not be allowed to dual-wield flintlock pistols.” – Andrew Hussie
“Your grandma always was an advocate of thorough preparedness. She would strongly advise staying not only armed to the teeth, but well equipped in the computational department. You’ve been taught you should really carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person.” – Andrew Hussie
“You figure you’ll cool it on the time travel for a while. Don’t want to see the Dave corpses start to pile up. Especially if one of them winds up being you.” – Andrew Hussie

“The SAFE was slain in battle. A great flaming nautical pyre carries it off to VAULTHALLA.” – Andrew Hussie

“Also, SKULLS. Gosh you love SKULLS. There is a good SKULL at the heart of any mystery, haunting it’s EVERY PAGE. That is what you always say. Or at least, it is what you always HOPE.” – Andrew Hussie
“As the prince of hope I’m uniquely qualified to recognize when all hope is lost.” – Andrew Hussie
“HS is supposedly a story that is also a game. In games, the characters die all the time. How many times did you let Mario fall in the pit before he saved the princess? Who weeps for these Marios. In games your characters die, but you keep trying and trying and rebooting and resetting until finally they make it. When you play a game this process is all very impersonal. Once you finally win, when all is said and done those deaths didn’t “count”, only the linear path of the final victorious version of the character is considered “real”. Mario never actually died, did he? Except the omniscient player knows better. HS seems to combine all the meaningless deaths of a trial-and-error game journey with the way death is treated dramatically in other media, where unlike our oblivious Mario, the characters are aware and afraid of the many deaths they must experience before finally winning the game.” – Andrew Hussie
“You figure you’ll cool it on the time travel for a while. Don’t want to see the Dave corpses start to pile up. Especially if one of them winds up being you.” – Andrew Hussie
“You come to the sobering realization that things will never stop from keep happening constantly.” – Andrew Hussie
“Lies of omission do not exist. The concept is a very human one. It is the product of your story writing again. You have written a story about the truth, making emotional demands of it, and in particular, of those in possession of it. Your demands are based on a feeling of entitlement to the facts, which is very childish. You can never know all of the facts. Only I can. And since it’s impossible for me to reveal all facts to you, it is my discretion alone that decides which facts will be revealed in the finite time we have. If I do not volunteer information you deem critical to your fate, it possibly means that I am a scoundrel, but it does not mean that I am a liar. And it certainly means you did not ask the right questions.” – Andrew Hussie
“One can make either true statements or false statements about reality. All of the statements I make are true.” – Andrew Hussie
“You love SITUATION COMEDIES, whilst holding particular affection for MUSTACHIOED FUNNY MEN. You know, your FOXWORTHIES, your FUNKES, your SWANSONS, but not necessarily your GALLAGHERS PER SE, because you have to draw the fucking line somewhere.” – Andrew Hussie
“Mutha. F***ing. Shenanigans.” – Andrew Hussie
“ROSE: I think I’ve spent too much time around Dave.
“You understand reality while everyone else is running around confused and angry and upset because they think reality is something happening to them rather than something they are making every moment with every thought.” – Andrew Hussie

“My city was betrayed by the weak…” – Andrew Ryan
“Before the final rat has eaten the last gram of you, Rapture will have returned. I will lead a parade. “Who was that,” they’ll say, as they point to the sad shape hanging on my wall, “who was that?” – Andrew Ryan
“Whenever anyone wants others to do their work they call upon their Altruism. ‘Never mind your own needs,’ they say, ‘Think of the needs of… of whoever. Of the state. Of the poor. Of the Army, of the King. Of God.’ The list goes on and on. How many catastrophes were launched with the words ‘Think of yourself?’ It’s the king and country crowd who light the torch of destruction.” – Andrew Ryan
“In what country is there a place for people like me?” – Andrew Ryan
“Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?” – Andrew Ryan
“Altruism is the root of all Wickedness.” – Andrew Ryan
“To build a city at the bottom of the sea: insanity. But where else could we be free from the clutching hand of the parasites? Where else could we build an economy that they would not try to control, a society they would not try to destroy? It was not impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.” – Andrew Ryan
“What would the Russian Bear and the American Eagle do if they discovered our paradise? Our secrecy is our shield!” – Andrew Ryan
“Stop, would you kindly? ‘Would you kindly’. Powerful phrase. Familiar phrase? Sit, would you kindly? Stand, would you kindly? Run! Stop! Turn. A man chooses, a slave obeys. Kill! A man chooses! A slave obeys! OBEY!” – Andrew Ryan
“It was not impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.” – Andrew Ryan
“Could I have made mistakes? One does not build cities if one is guided by doubt. But can one govern in absolute certainty? I know that my beliefs have elevated me, just as I know that the things I have rejected would have destroyed me. But the city… it is collapsing before my… have I become so convinced by my own beliefs that I have stopped seeing the truth? Perhaps. But Atlas is out there, and he aims to destroy me, and destroy my city. To question is to surrender. I will not question.” – Andrew Ryan
“Lacking its own ingenuity, the parasite fears the visionary. What it cannot plagiarize, it seeks to censor. What it cannot regulate, it seeks to ban.” – Andrew Ryan
“In the end what separates a man from a slave? Money? Power? No, a man chooses, and a slave obeys!” – Andrew Ryan
“With the sweat of your brow. Rap­ture can become your city as well.” – Andrew Ryan
“I am Andrew Ryan, and I am here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? ‘No,’ says the man in Washington, ‘it belongs to the poor.’ ‘No,’ says the man in the Vatican, ‘it belongs to God.’ ‘No,’ says the man in Moscow, ‘it belongs to everyone.’ I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose Rapture.” – Andrew Ryan
“An artist strives to frame his ideals in an image; to challenge his audience and to make his vision immortal. But the parasites say ‘no, your art must serve the cause… your ideals endanger the people!” – Andrew Ryan
“A man has a choice.. I chose.. the impossible!.” – Andrew Ryan
“I built a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the great would not be constrained by the small, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. I chose to build Rapture. But my city was betrayed by the weak. So I ask you, if your life was priced would you kill the innocent? Would you sacrifice your humanity? We all make choices but in the end our choices make us.” – Andrew Ryan
“No gods or kings, only men.” – Andrew Ryan
“Why worship a flag or a God, when we can worship that which is best in us: our will to be great.” – Andrew Ryan 
“I believe in no God, no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us, a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us. But it is only when we struggle in our own interest that the chain pulls society in the right direction. The chain is too powerful and too mysterious for any government to guide. Any man who tells you differently either has his hand in your pocket, or a pistol to your neck.” – Andrew Ryan
“God did not plant the seeds of this Arcadia. I did.” – Andrew Ryan
“What is the difference between a man and a parasite? A man builds, a parasite asks ‘Where’s my share?’ A man creates, a parasite says ‘What will the neighbors think?’ A man invents, a parasite says ‘Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of God…” – Andrew Ryan

And I think that’s true of music and art and literature.” – Sean Lennon
“My problem with political art is not that it’s bad art necessarily, but that it is terrible politics. We’re talking about a closeted person with minimum contact with reality who has trouble tying his f**king shoes! And he’s supposed to be political? A bus driver has a better perspective on things. Artists are completely indulgent.” – Jonathan Santlofer
“My argument would be that I don’t think there is much that’s genuinely political art that is good art.” – Thom Yorke
“It is difficult to make political artwork.” – Thom Yorke

At this point, people are living spread out and hence are at the mercy of stronger animals, who begin killing them off… They seek to save themselves from the beasts by banding together and forming cities. But they do injustice to one another, at such close quarters, because they lack the political art. So, dispersed once more, they begin perishing again.” – Paul Ludwig Landsberg

“What do you think an artist is? An imbecile who only has eyes if he’s a painter, ears if he’s a musician, or a lyre in every chamber of his heart if he’s a poet – or even, if he’s a boxer, only some muscles? Quite the contrary, he is at the same time a political being constantly alert to the horrifying, passionate, or pleasing events in the world, shaping himself completely in their image. How is it possible to be uninterested in other men and by virtue of what cold nonchalance can you detach yourself from the life that they supply so copiously? No, painting is not made to decorate apartments. It’s an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy.” – Pablo Picasso
“History proves over and over again that culture is ideally suitable for political propaganda, especially under totalitarian rule.” – Slavenka Drakulić

“There’s an axiom I live by: ‘There is no art without politics.’ You either choose to engage it, or you choose political apathy. This ties in with ideas around real-time performance and feedback.” – Chris Jordan

“Politics is the gentle art of getting votes from the poor and campaign funds from the rich, by promising to protect each from the other.” – Oscar Ameringer
“I avoid contemporary TV … politics … art: all too frantic, fevered, and frivolous, or else angry, bitter.” – Dean Koontz
“Rock was different from rock and roll. Rock was virtuosic and adult, as opposed to popsy and teenaged. Rock and roll were apolitical and fun, while the rock was “heavy” and often political, creating vistas of psychic energy that carried beyond the music itself and into radical politics and art.” – Stephen Davis
“Wise politics is the art of invigorating society and weakening the State.” – Nicolas Gomez Davila
“History is not just about dates and quotations. And it’s not just about politics, the military, and social issues, though much of it of course is about that. It’s about everything. It’s about the life history. It’s human. And we have to see it that way. We have to teach it that way. We have to read it that way. It’s about art, music, literature, money, science, love – the human experience.” – David McCullough

“For us, collecting is a consuming interest and a way of life.” – Daniel Greenberg

“The great innovation for collectors has to be the installment plan.” – Michael Mendelsohn

“Eventually, a collection ceases to be a personal indulgence and assumes its own identity. In fact, it becomes a thing in its own right – rather like Frankenstein’s monster.” – Howard Hodgkin

“The collector of today is looking for a figure of great aesthetic quality, rather than just what he can afford. The material you are working with has to move you–art has to be a physical, mental, and visual experience. A collector should not be concerned with whether the economy is high or low. He has developed beyond the economic strata of the moment.” – Allan Chait

“I am only limited by the amount of life I have left to capture the ideas I am already working on. Another problem is that I am not sure if I would rather create or collect art. Collecting art is another passion of mine.” – Richard Mcdonald

“In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free – honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just – a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“I do not wish to be misunderstood upon this subject of slavery in this country. I suppose it may long exist, and perhaps the best way for it to come to an end peaceably is for it to exist for a length of time. But I say that the spread and strengthening and perpetuation of it is an entirely different proposition. There we should in every way resist it as a wrong, treating it as a wrong, with the fixed idea that it must and will come to an end.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“I have always thought that all men should be free; but if any should be slaves it should be first those who desire it for themselves, and secondly those who desire it for others.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved – I do not expect the house to fall – but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“Now, I confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral, social and political evil, having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown about it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong, and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“I think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question (slavery). They have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores—plasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have proved so temporary—so evanescent.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted. For this, neither has any just occasion to be angry with the other.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.” – Abraham Lincoln 
“I have always hated slavery, I think as much as any abolitionist.” – Abraham Lincoln

“I was born into a working-class Irish Catholic family at the brutal bottom of the Great Depression. I suppose this early imprinting and conditioning made me a life-long radical. My education was mostly scientific, majoring in electrical engineering and applied math. Those imprints made me a life-long rationalist.

“Your inner growth is completely dependent upon the realization that the only way to find peace and contentment is to stop thinking about yourself.” – Michael A. Singer

“So there are two ways you can live: you can devote your life to staying in your comfort zone, or you can work on your freedom.” – Michael A. Singer
“The alternative is to decide not to fight with life. You realize and accept that life is not under your control. Life is continuously changing, and if you’re trying to control it, you’ll never be able to fully live it. Instead of living life, you’ll be afraid of it.” – Michael A. Singer
“You are a great being who has been given a tremendous opportunity to explore beyond yourself. The whole process is very exciting, and you will have good times and bad times. All sorts of things will happen. That’s the fun of the journey.” – Michael A. Singer
“The spiritual journey is one of constant transformation. In order to grow, you must give up the struggle to remain the same, and learn to embrace change at all times.” – Michael A. Singer

“How do you free yourself? In the deepest sense, you free yourself by finding yourself. You are not the pain you feel, nor are you the part that periodically stresses out. None of these disturbances have anything to do with you. You are the one who notices these things.” – Michael A. Singer
“You are capable of ceasing the absurdity of listening to the perpetual problems of your psyche. You can put an end to it.

Work can be fun, a family can be fun, you can just enjoy it all.” – Michael A. Singer
“Just relieve your mind of the job of making sure that everyone and everything will be the way you need them to be so that you can feel better inside.” – Michael A. Singer
“Everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that’s the only time everything will be okay.” – Michael A. Singer
“The minute you stop putting your whole heart and soul into the mind as if it were your savior and protector, you will find yourself behind the mind watching it. That’s how you know about your thoughts: you are in there watching them. Eventually, you will be able to just sit in there quietly, and consciously watch the mind.” – Michael A. Singer
“One of the essential requirements for true spiritual growth and deep personal transformation is coming to peace with pain.” – Michael A. Singer
“In truth, pain is the price of freedom. And the moment you are willing to pay that price, you will no longer be afraid. The moment you are not afraid of the pain, you’ll be able to face all of life’s situations without fear.” – Michael A. Singer

“The greatest gift one can give to God is to be pleased with his creation.” – Michael A. Singer
“Stress only happens when you resist life’s events. If you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place. If you choose to live this way, you will see that life can be lived in a state of peace.” – Michael A. Singer
“Fortunately, deep within us, there is a direct connection to the Divine. There is a part of our being that is beyond the personal self. You can consciously choose to identify with that part, rather than with the psyche or the body. When you do this, a natural transformation begins to take place within.” – Michael A. Singer
“As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.” – Michael A. Singer

“If you decide that you’re going to be happy from now on for the rest of your life, you will not only be happy, you will become enlightened. Unconditional happiness is the highest technique there is.This is truly a spiritual path, and it as direct and sure a path to Awakening as could possibly exist.” – Michael A. Singer
“You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience.” – Michael A. Singer

“Fear is the cause of every problem. It’s the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness. If you had no fear, you could be perfectly happy living in this world.” – Michael A. Singer
“You don’t fight the mind. In fact, you don’t even try to change it. You just make a game out of relaxing in the face of its melodrama.” – Michael A. Singer
“To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to objectively watch your problems instead of being lost in them.” – Michael A. Singer
“If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.” – Michael A. Singer
“Look at this thing. It’s ruining my life. I’m trying to live a peaceful, meaningful existence, but I feel like I’m sitting on top of a volcano. At any moment this thing can decide to freak, close down, and fight with what’s happening.” – Michael A. Singer
“Ultimately, if you protect yourself perfectly, you will never grow.” – Michael A. Singer

“There is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out” – Michael A. Singer
“True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection.” – Michael A. Singer

“The present is choosing to believe that your own life is worth investing deeply in, instead of waiting for some rare miracle or fairy tale.” – Shauna Niequist
“My mentor’s words rang in my ears: Stop. Right now. Remake your life from the inside out. I don’t know a way to remake anything without first taking down the existing structures, and that’s what no does—it puts the brakes on your screaming-fast life and gives you a chance to stop and inspect just exactly what you’ve created for yourself, as difficult as that might be.” – Shauna Niequist
“The world will tell you how to live if you let it. Don’t let it. Take up your space. Raise your voice. Sing your song. This is your chance to make or remake a life that thrills you.” – Shauna Niequist
“I don’t want to get to the end of my life and look back and realize that the best thing about me as I was organized.” – Shauna Niequist
“What people think about you means nothing in comparison to what you believe about yourself.” – Shauna Niequist
”What’s changing everything for me is a new understanding that we get to decide how we want to live. We get to shape our days and our weeks, and if we don’t, they’ll get shaped by the wide catch-all of “normal” and “typical,” and who wants that?” – Shauna Niequist
“The best thing I can offer to this world is not my force or energy, but a well-tended spirit, a wise and brave soul.” – Shauna Niequist

“How far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?” – Nicholas Sparks

“He felt as though he were failing in practically every area of his life. Lately, happiness seemed as distant and unattainable to him as space travel. He hadn’t always felt this way. There had been a long period of time during which he remembered being very happy. But things change. People change. Change was one of the inevitable laws of nature, exacting its toll on people’s lives. Mistakes are made, regrets form, and all that was left were repercussions that made something as simple as rising from the bed seem almost laborious.” – Nicholas Sparks
“Love is a wonderful thing. It makes life worthwhile. I love being in love.” – Nicholas Sparks
“Traveling has less to do with seeing things than experiencing them…” – Nicholas Sparks
“He leaned closer, their faces drawing near, and he could feel the heat of her breath mingling with his. He closed his eyes against the memory of a thousand other kisses and touched his lips to hers.

She was the arm that held him close in times of trouble, she was the whisper on the pillow beside him at night.” – Nicholas Sparks
“The past was gone and the future had yet to unfold, and he knew he should focus his life on the present…yet his day-to-day existence suddenly struck him as endless and unbearable.” – Nicholas Sparks
“I love you, Gabby, more than you’ll ever know. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted in a wife. You’re every hope and every dream I’ve ever had, and you’ve made me happier than any man could possibly be. I don’t ever want to give that up. I can’t.” – Nicholas Sparks
“Some things were beyond understanding.” – Nicholas Sparks

“There were moments when it honestly seemed as if the world were conspiring against her.” – Nicholas Sparks
“Spending time with you showed me what I’ve been missing in my life. The more time we spent together, the more I could imagine it lasting in the future. That’s never happened to me before, and I’m not sure it’ll ever happen again. I’ve never been in love with anyone before you came along — not real love anyway…not like this. And I’d be a fool if I let you slip away without a fight” – Nicholas Sparks
“He’d lived long enough to know that everyone handles grief in different ways, and little by little, they all seemed to accept their new lives.” – Nicholas Sparks
“That’s another reason I keep putting marriage off. I know I want something like what you two share, and I’m not sure I’ve found it yet. I’m not sure I ever will. And with love like that…they say anything’s possible, right?” – Nicholas Sparks

“He was so different from her, yet in his presence she felt the possibility of another kind of life, a life she had never imagined could be hers. A life without the rigid limitations others had always set for her.” – Nicholas Sparks
“It always amazes me that once you cut through the clutter, people are pretty much the same. Especially through adolescence and early adulthood. For the most part, people go through the same experiences and think the same things, but somehow no one ever escapes the belief that his experience is unique in every conceivable way.” – Nicholas Sparks
“You are in so much more trouble than I thought you were!” – Nicholas Sparks

“A new kind of award has been added — the deathbed award. It is not an award of any kind. Either the recipient has not acted at all, or was not nominated, or did not win the award the last few times around. It is intended to relieve the guilty conscience of the Academy members and save face in front of the public. The Academy has the horrible taste to have a star, choking with emotion, present this deathbed award so that there can be no doubt in anybody’s mind why the award is so hurriedly given. Lucky is the actor who is too sick to watch the proceedings on television.” – Marlene Dietrich

“Man comes not from an egg but from an animalcule that is found in male sperm.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“Passing just lately over this lake, … and examining this water next day, I found floating therein divers earthy particles, and some green streaks, spirally wound serpent-wise, and orderly arranged, after the manner of the copper or tin worms, which distillers use to cool their liquors as they distil over. The whole circumference of each of these streaks was about the thickness of a hair of one’s head. … all consisted of very small green globules joined together: and there were very many small green globules as well.

“I have divers times examined the same matter (human semen) from a healthy man… not from a sick man… nor spoiled by keeping… for a long time and not liquefied after the lapse of some time… but immediately after ejaculation before six beats of the pulse had intervened; and I have seen so great a number of living animalcules… in it, that sometimes more than a thousand were moving about in an amount of material the size of a grain of sand… I saw this vast number of animalcules not all through the semen, but only in the liquid matter adhering to the thicker part.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek  
“The 31th of May, I perceived in the same water more of those Animals, as also some that were somewhat bigger. And I imagine, that [ten hundred thousand] of these little Creatures do not equal an ordinary grain of Sand in bigness: And comparing them with a Cheese-mite (which may be seen to move with the naked eye) I make the proportion of one of these small Water-creatures to a Cheese-mite, to be like that of a Bee to a Horse: For, the circumference of one of these little Animals in water, is not so big as the thickness of a hair in a Cheese-mite.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
“No one can pretend to say that a fish is ever killed by heat, for many kinds of fish, in the middle of summer, and in the burning heat of the sun, do either play, as it were, on the surface of the water, or hide themselves under the leaves, weeds, or other substances at the bottom.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

“The 4th sort of creatures… which moved through the 3 former sorts, were incredibly small, and so small in my eye that I judged, that if 100 of them lay [stretched out] one by another, they would not equal the length of a grain of course Sand; and according to this estimate, ten hundred thousand of them could not equal the dimensions of a grain of such coarse Sand. There was discovered by me a fifth sort, which was near the thickness of the former, but they were almost twice as long. The first time bacteria were observed.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
“Just as the supposed number may differ from the true number by fully 100, 150, or even 200 in a flock of 600 sheep, so may I be even more out of my reckoning in the case of these very little animalcules.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

“If any person examines by the microscope that part towards the extremity of the spider’s body from whence its thread proceeds, he will observe the spot to be, as it were, surrounded by five several protuberances or risings, each ending in a point and altogether forming a kind of enclosure.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“We have seen so many, and those of his [Leeuwenhoek] most surprising discoveries, so perfectly confirmed by great numbers of the most curious and judicious Observers, that there can surely be no reason to distrust his accuracy in those others which have not yet been so frequently or carefully examined.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“I’ve never taught one, because if I taught one, I’d have to teach others… I would give myself over to a slavery, whereas I want to stay a free man.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“My determination is not to remain stubbornly with my ideas but I’ll leave them and go over to others as soon as I am shown a plausible reason which I can grasp. This is the more true since I have no other purpose than to place truth before my eyes so far as it is in my power to embrace it; and to use the little talent I have received to draw the world away from its old heathenish superstitions and to go over to the truth and to stick to it.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“They were about the size of a large grain of sand, and their bodies being transparent, that the internal motion could plainly be seen.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

“We will admit that, out of the mud or sand which is found on the seashore or the beds of our rivers, at low water, shellfish or testaceous animals come forth, but it does not from thence by any means follow that they are produced without any regular course of generation.” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
“How inscrutable and incomprehensible are the hidden works of Nature!” – Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

“In a faraway land called ‘pre-2000,’ what Earthlings now call blogging was called ‘keeping a diary.’ It’s hard work to do well.

In addition, you’ll find it easier and more desirable to change because there is something—some core deep within—that is essentially changeless.” – Stephen R. Covey
“Most believe that the key to influence is communication—getting your point across clearly and speaking persuasively. In fact, if you think about it, don’t you find that, while others are speaking to you, instead of really listening to understand, you are often busy preparing your response?” – Stephen R. Covey

“I do not regard the rise of women as a bad sign. Rather do I fancy that her traditional subordination was itself an artificial and undesirable condition based on Oriental influences. Our virile Teutonic ancestors did not think their wives unworthy to follow them into battle, or scorn to dream of winged Valkyries bearing them to Valhalla.” – H. P. Lovecraft
“As for the primitive, I hark back to it because we are still very primitive. How many thousands of years of culture, think you, have rubbed and polished at our raw edges? One probably; at the best, no more than two. And that takes us back to screaming savagery, when, gross of body and deed, we drank blood from the skulls of our enemies, and hailed as highest paradise the orgies and carnage of Valhalla.” – Jack London

“Though I suppose you would have like that better since you Northmen are so eager to die.
“Africa is mystic; it is wild; it is a sweltering inferno; it is a photographer’s paradise, a hunter’s Valhalla, an escapist’s Utopia. It is what you will, and it withstands all interpretations. It is the last vestige of a dead world or the cradle of a shiny new one. To a lot of people, as to myself, it is just ‘home’. It is all these things but one thing – it is never dull.” – Beryl Markham
“No man should go to Valhalla with brothel rash.” – Mark Lawrence

And there, there we shall meet again, and fight and drink and… love one another.” – Legartha
“I have had a sign. A sign that blood must be spilled, a sacrifice be made. I have waited a long time for such a sign. And now my purpose is clear.” – Floki
“Nearby is Valhalla, vast, and gold-bright. And every day, Odin chooses slain men to join him. They arm themselves and fight in the courtyard. They kill one another, but every night they rise again and ride back to the hall, and feast. The roof is made out of shields. The rafters are spears. Coats of mail litter the benches. A wolf stands at the Western door and an eagle hovers above it. It has five hundred and forty doors, and when Ragnarok comes, eight hundred warriors will march out of each door, shoulder to shoulder.” – Floki
“Warrior dont show their heart until the axe reveals it.” – Floki
“It gladdens me to know that Baldr’s father [Odin] makes ready the benches for a banquet. Soon we shall be drinking ale from the curved horns. The champion who comes into Odin’s dwelling [Valhalla] does not lament his death. I shall not enter his hall with words of fear upon my lips. The Æsir will welcome me. Death comes without lamenting… Eager am I to depart. The Dísir summon me home, those whom Odin sends for me [Valkyries] from the halls of the Lord of Hosts. Gladly shall I drink ale in the high-seat with the Æsir. The days of my life are ended. I laugh as I die.” – Ragnar Lodbrok

“The human brain is the universe’s most implausible science experiment.” – Will Boast
“The Constitution defends all of us against unreasonable search and seizure. What constitutes reasonableness depends upon the threat.” – Michael Hayden

“Stagefright, like epilepsy, is a divine ailment, a sacred madness. It is a grace that is sufficient in the old Jesuit sense – that is, insufficient by itself but a necessary condition for success.” – Charles Rosen

“A big seizure just kind of grabs the inside of your skull and squeezes. It feels as if it’s twisting and turning your brain all up and down and inside out. Have you ever heard a washing machine suddenly flip into that bang-bang-bang sound when it gets out of balance, or a chain saw when the chain breaks and gets caught up in the gears, or an animal like a cat, screeching in pain? Those are what seizures felt like when I was little.” – Terry Trueman
“Electricity is life but electricity is an invisible fist punching up your spine, knocking your brains right out of your skull.” – Ray Robinson
“Epilepsy is a disease in the shadows. Patients are often reluctant to admit their condition – even to close family, friends or co-workers – because there’s still a great deal of stigma and mystery surrounding the disease that plagued such historical figures as Julius Caesar, Edgar Allan Poe and Lewis Carroll.” – Lynda Resnick
“Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think।” – Christopher Robin

“The erosion of privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment, written to protect us against unreasonable search and seizure, began in earnest under President George W. Bush.” – Rebecca MacKinnon
“[Epilepsy] gave her adversity to fight against. It had shaped her personality, the need to be careful and secretive, and the ability to see things a bit differently from the neurotypical. She granted that this feeling of having a broken brain that required her to be sensitive, to look always inward to survive, might be why she turned artist.” – Thomm Quackenbush

“It’s easier for me to make sense of it that way than it is for me to face the other way reality. And yet, those evil spirits that were unleashed be they fake entities from a stupid carnival ride, or cruel malevolencies from dark spiritual chasms of our universe have stayed with me all these years।” – Tim Cummings
“I didn’t get my licence because I wasn’t allowed to. But I haven’t had a seizure for a long time so I could, theoretically, get my licence. But I’m now just so used to not driving, I’m scared of what I’d do।” – Hugo Weaving
“When people affected by epilepsy are reluctant to expose their condition, the public remains in the dark about it – a tragic irony that has made patient care and raising funds for research more than challenging.” – Lynda Resnick
“No one is in control of your happiness but you; therefore, you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change.” – Barbara De Angelis
“If an epileptic seizure is focused in a particular sweet spot in the temporal lobe, a person wonÂ´t have motor seizures, but instead something more subtle. The effect is something like a cognitive seizure, marked by changes of personality, hyper religiosity (an obsession with religion and feelings of religious certainty), hypergraphia (extensive writing on a subject, usually about religion), the false sense of an external presence, and, often, the hearing voices that are attributed to a god. Some fraction of historyÂ´s prophets, martyrs, and leaders appear to have had temporal lobe epilepsy.” – David Eagleman
“Having epilepsy does not mean you have to expect and cope with depression. You have as much right to help and support as anyone else.” – Anonymous
“People think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don’t have any idea what causes epilepsy. But I believe that someday we will understand what causes epilepsy, and at that moment, we will cease to believe that it’s divine. And so it is with everything in the universe” – Hippocrates

“We’ve been creeping up and doing better and better each year, but when we get MCAS back I will not be surprised if we’ve stalled somewhat and we’re not meeting our targets, … You get what you pay for and when all is said and done and all these years of level funding will show that we’re not meeting AYP (state standards).” – Paul Revere

“It is convenient for the old men to blame Eve. To insist we are damned because a country girl talked to the snake one afternoon long ago. Children must starve in Somalia for that, and old women are abandoned in our greatest cities. It’s why we will finally be thrown into the lakes of molten lead. Because she was confused by happiness that the first time anyone said she was beautiful. Nevertheless, she must be the issue, so people won’t notice that rocks and galaxies, mathematics, and rust are also created in His image.” – Jack Gilbert

“Love is the only weapon.” Shit! Bullshit! Martin Luther King died with love! Kennedy died talking about something he couldn’t even understand, some kind of generalized love, and he never even backed it up. He was shot down. Bullshit! “Love is the only weapon with which I’ve got to fight.” I’ve got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight! I’ve got my claws. I’ve got cutlasses. I’ve got guns. I’ve got a dynamite. I’ve got a hell of a lot to fight! I’ll fight! I’ll fight!” – Jim Jones

“I think they are a very dangerous basketball team, a team that could create a lot of problems.” – Dick Vitale
“My wife knows diddly about basketball, but if you put her here and said, ‘Look at Colorado’s resume, look at UAB, and look at VCU,’ it’d be an (inaudible) mismatch, man. It would be like a beauty contest—Roseanne Barr walking in versus Scarlett Johansson. No shot. None, whatsoever.” – Dick Vitale
“The Heels are on fire. Somebody call up the fire chief to put out the fire.” – Dick Vitale

“My wife grabbed me [when] we got out of the church. She said, ‘Don’t make a big scene with the committee like you do every year. Finding one team—and we always find one—and we battle and battle, but you know what? I can’t take it, man, when I see kids be given a raw deal.” – Dick Vitale

“John Wooden has been a vital force in the lives of many with his inspirational messages.  He represents all the elements necessary to be a winner in the Game of Life, which makes him the perfect person to write this book filled with lessons.  Coach Wooden has been a mentor to people in every walk of life.” – Dick Vitale
“Every one of us bears within him the possibility of all passions, all destinies of life in all its manifold forms. Nothing human is foreign to us.” – Edward G Robinson
“I remember just before going onto the soundstage, I’d look in my dressing room mirror and stretch myself to my full 5’5″ or 5’6″–whatever it was–to make me appear taller and to make me able to dominate all the others and to mow them down with my size.” – Edward G Robinson

“In those days I would go for an interview and find myself competing with this other chap who would always be younger and taller, and much handsomer than I.” – Edward G Robinson
“I didn’t play at collecting. No cigar anywhere was safe from me.” – Edward G Robinson
“If I were just a bit taller and I was a little more handsome or something like that, I could have played all the roles that I have played, and played many more. There is such a thing as a handicap, but you’ve got to be that much better as an actor. It kept me from certain roles that I might have had, but then, it kept others from playing my roles, so I don’t know that it’s not altogether balanced.” – Edward G Robinson
“It was, in fact, the third lead. I debated accepting it. Emanuel Goldberg told me that at my age it was time to begin thinking of character roles, to slide into middle and old age with the same grace as that marvelous actor Lewis Stone . . . The decision made itself. It remains one of my favorites.” – Edward G Robinson
“I have not collected art. Art collected me. I never found paintings. They found me. I have never even owned a work of art. They owned me.” – Edward G Robinson
“To be entrusted with a character was always a big responsibility to me.” – Edward G Robinson

“Ah yes, I remember well what it was like to be a true collector, that soft explosion in the heart, that thundering inner “Yes!” when you see something you must have or die. For over 30 years I made periodic visits to [Auguste Renoir’s] “Luncheon of the Boating Party” in a Washington museum, and stood before that magnificent masterpiece hour after hour, day after day, plotting ways to steal it.” – Edward G Robinson
“Of course, I started as a collector. A true collector. I can remember as if it were only yesterday the heart-pounding excitement as I spread out upon the floor of my bedroom The Edward G. Robinson Collection of Rare Cigar Bands. I didn’t play at collecting. No cigar anywhere was safe from me. My father and uncles and all their friends turned their lungs black trying to satisfy my collector’s zeal. And then came cigarette cards, big-league baseball players. I was an insatiable fiend, and would cheerfully trade you three Indian Joes for one of that upstart newcomer, Ty Cobb.” – Edward G Robinson
“Paintings never really belong to one of us. If we are fortunate, as I have been, we are allowed at most a lovely time of custody.” – Edward G Robinson
“Acting and painting have much in common. You begin with the external appearance and then strip away the layers to get to the essential core. This is reality and that is how an artist achieves truth. When you are acting, you are playing a part, you are being somebody else. You are also, at the same time, being yourself.” – Edward G Robinson
“Some people have youth, some have beauty – I have menace.” – Edward G Robinson
“The sitting around on the set is awful. But I always figure that’s what they pay me for. The acting I do for free.” – Edward G Robinson

“Live beyond your means, then you’re forced to work hard, you have to succeed.” – Edward G Robinson
“To last you need to be real.” – Edward G Robinson
“You gave me the greatest exit a ‘heavy’ ever had. No actor would break friendship with a writer who created a tempest, then an earthquake, then opened a fissure and had me fall through into hell. Even in Little Caesar (1931) I never had an exit as good as that!” – Edward G Robinson
This one starts out badly; “Edward G. Robinson was a Romanian actor.”

“Like I said, a sketch is one joke. They shouldn’t really be more than a minute, two minutes. There are some shows where the sketch goes on for five minutes. It’s like, “I get it! I’m already bored. I did like the joke, but I don’t anymore because you went on for too long.” – Eric Andre

“I feel like we put all the weight on the president, rather than distributing the weight to all of the elected officials.” – Eric Andre  
“I feel the acting conservatory taught me how to be a working actor in the 1700s. We learned stuff like ‘to the back of the auditorium, to the back of the auditorium’ and the liquid “u.” ‘The payment is duuue on Tuuuesday.’ I also learned how to fence. If anything, when I moved to Los Angeles, I didn’t fit in, in any way. I had to do comedy, because I was talking so pretentiously.” – Eric Andre
“I just grew up with it [The Simpsons]. The first season came on when I was 5, 6 years old, and the show evolved as I was growing up and got funnier and funnier and, by the time I was in 12th grade, they were at their funniest” – Eric Andre

“I don’t think comedians take advantage of the fact that television and film are visual mediums.” – Eric Andre
“They [The Simpsons] are just like the Bible to me as far as what the high-water mark of comedy.” – Eric Andre
“You see a lot of sketch variety shows where each segment is one joke that they repeat over and over and over again, and the sketches are always three or four minutes too long.” – Eric Andre
“If the crowd is full of assholes, it’s no fun. If the crowd is cool, it’s great” – Eric Andre
“I have done some formal acting training because I sucked at acting when I first got to Los Angeles. I’m still one of the worst actors and auditions out there.” – Eric Andre
“I think that we put too much weight on who the president is.” – Eric Andre
“The Simpsons was pretty experimental at the time, but it attracted a lot of sitcom writers that felt confined by the limitations of live-action sitcoms in the ’80s.” – Eric Andre
“If there’s an intelligence behind the joke – – it’s a good joke.” – Eric Andre
“I’m insecure, and I need the validation of strangers to feel whole. So, I need every single racist 12-year-old on the Internet to like me, or I don’t feel complete.” – Eric Andre
“I will smoke crack before I die. I want to see what all the hubbub is about.” – Eric Andre

“The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked and said to him “I cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of.” “Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the Woodman, “when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side” – L. Frank Baum

“We must all make do with the rags of love we find flapping on the scarecrow of humanity” – Angela Carter
“The thing you fail to grasp is that people are not basically good. We are basically selfish. We shove and clamor and cry for adoration, and beat down everyone else to get it. Life is a competition of prattling peacocks enraptured in inane mating rituals. But for all our effacing and self-importance, we are all slaves to what we fear most. You have so very much to learn. Here. Let me teach you” – Christopher Nolan
“Everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it” – L. Frank Baum
“Your self-image tells about what you think about yourself and how you appear to yourself in your own consciousness. Self-image is the picture of yourself carried in your own mind. That picture can scare you or inspire you!” – Israelmore Ayivor

“They were great philosophies, simple philosophies. That everybody had a heart, everyone had a brain, everyone had the courage, these were the gifts that were given to you; and if you use them properly, you reach the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

“A grimy ghost hovered above a smiling scarecrow that looked puny next to an oversized bat being watched by a wicked witch who was entangled in the web of an even larger spider that was in danger of being eaten by a bug-eyed owl that peeped out of the faux foliage, much more nostalgic than scary” – Kevin Purdy

“The natural/supernatural distinction itself, and the near-equation of ‘supernatural’ with ‘superstition’, are scarecrows that Enlightenment thought has erected in its fields to frighten away anyone following the historical argument where it leads.

“Human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.

“I think the guitar is the best thing in the world” – Shaun White

“A king may be a tool, a thing of straw; but if he serves to frighten our enemies, and secure our property, it is well enough; a scarecrow is a thing of straw, but it protects the corn” – Alexander Pope
“I don’t really diet or anything. I’m miserable when I’m dieting and I like the way I look.

“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,'” said the Scarecrow. ‘I know it,’ returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. ‘It is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.’ ‘Perhaps you have heart disease,’ said the Tin Woodman. ‘It may be,’ said the Lion” – L. Frank Baum

The parties to it understand it least; but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes, without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises” – Charles Dickens
“In literature and in art, alike, this gloomy fashion of Death has been characteristic of Christianity.

“Oh, I see;” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.” Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.

“A king is a mortal god on earth, unto whom the living God hath lent his own name as a great honor; but withal told him, he should die like a man, lest he should be proud, and flatter himself that God hath with his name imparted unto him his nature also. JOHN LOCKE, “Of a King”, The Conduct of the Understanding: Essays, Moral, Economical, and Political A king may be a tool, a thing of straw; but if he serves to frighten our enemies, and secure our property, it is well enough: a scarecrow is a thing of straw, but it protects the corn” – Alexander Pope
“To be a good mother, a woman must have sense and that independence of mind which few women possess who are taught to depend entirely on their husbands. Meek wives are, in general, foolish mothers; wanting their children to love them best, and take their part, in secret, against the father, who is held up as a scarecrow” – Mary Wollstonecraft
“A capacity for inferiority in the growing adult is threatened by the temptation by squandering that capacity ruthlessly, to revel in hollowness. The syndrome especially plaques anyone who lives behind a mask. An elephant in her disguise as a human princess, a scarecrow with painted features, a glittering tiara under which to glow and glide in anonymous glamour. A witch’s hat, a wizard stole, a scholar gown, a soldier’s dress sartorial. A hundred ways to duck the question: how will I live with myself now that I know what I know” – Gregory Maguire
“The greatest burden in the world is superstition, not only of ceremonies in the church but of imaginary and scarecrow sins at home” – John Milton

“Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit, has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means.

There are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful. … They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead” – Henry A. Wallace

“He’d never touched a stick before and now he is just eating, sleeping and breathing lacrosse” – Andy Shoop

If I had my choice, I would have every player under the age of twelve play box lacrosse exclusively or at least a majority of the time. The number of touches of the ball and the ability to develop better stick skills in a game of box lacrosse, far surpasses what happens to young people on a 110 x 60-yard field.

“Lacrosse is like one of those diseases that comes through the family and infects everybody. It caught every one of us” – Ted Wolford

We create our own causes, and karma adjusts the effects with perfect balance” – Mary T Browne

“Affirmative action was designed originally for “women and other minorities” but the phrase has become just another tortured euphemism. Female conscientiousness and eagerness to please have always made women good students and natural test-takers. Jews have gloried in scholarship throughout the ages, and Asians of both sexes score so high on SATs and IQ tests that they regard affirmative action as an impediment. Affirmative action really means favoritism for blacks for the sake of racial peace, but the favor is a pure chimera, and so, increasingly, is the peace” – Florence King
“My hope is that digital technology will level things out more and that it will eventually eliminate favoritism. But technology cannot do it alone.

“If I treat everyone the same way, I am for sure being biased because each individual is unique” – Robert Whipple
“All experience teaches that, whenever there is a great national establishment, employing large numbers of officials, the public must be reconciled to support many incompetent men; for such is the favoritism and nepotism always prevailing in the purlieus of these establishments, that some incompetent persons are always admitted, to the exclusion of many of the worthy” – Herman Melville
“Leaders who practice favoritism in the workplace have no chance to build a culture of trust” – Robert Whipple
“The Obama administration’s agenda of maximizing dependency involves political favoritism cloaked in the raiment of “economic planning” and “social justice” that somehow produce results superior to what markets produce when freedom allows merit to manifest itself, and incompetence to fail. The administration’s central activity – the political allocation of wealth and opportunity – is not merely susceptible to corruption, it is corruption” – George Will

If one link of the chain is broken, the chain is broken” – Anna Julia Cooper

“God does not show favoritism” – Unknown
“The system happens to be Washington and the way politics works because whatever it is, it isn’t working. It defies common sense. And part and parcel of this, right in the middle of it is the media and their lying and their distorting and their favoritism and their efforts to impugn and destroy people like us who want to stop this mess that’s been progressing in a deteriorating way for way too many years” – Rush Limbaugh
“Secondly, as a result of this political favoritism, the FDA has become a primary factor in that formula whereby cartel-oriented companies in the food and drug industry are able to use the police powers of government to harass or destroy their free-market competitors” – G. Edward Griffin
“Indeed, bribery, favoritism, and corruption in a great variety of forms were rampant not only in politics but in all levels of society” – Unknown
“From secrecy and deception in high places; come home, America. From military spending so wasteful that it weakens our nation; come home, America.

“Punishing enemies and rewarding friends – politics Chicago style – seems to be the unifying principle that helps explain the Obamacare waivers, the NLRB action against Boeing and IRS’s gift tax assault on 501(c)(4) donors. They look like examples of crony capitalism, bailout favoritism, and gangster government. One thing they don’t look like is the rule of law” – Michael Barone

“If we treated everyone we meet with the same affection we bestow upon our favorite cat, they, too, would purr” – Martin Delany
“To say grace, knowing that people on this globe are starving, indicates a highly selfish acquiescence in the arrogantly supposed favoritism of the almighty. A really decent god-believer, far from giving thanks for the food and good health and fortune enjoyed by himself and his family and close friends, would surely curse God for his neglect of the hungry, the sick and the tormented, throughout the world” – Barbara Smoker  
“It is horrifyingly obvious now that getting more attention isn’t necessarily favoritism” – N K Jemisin

“That night for the first time in my life I realized that it is the physical presence of people and their spirits that gives a town life. With the absence of so many people, the town became scary., the night darker, and the silence unbearably agitating. Normally, the crickets and the birds sang in the evening before the sun went down.

“At night it felt as if we were walking with the moon. It followed us under thick clouds and waited for us at the other end of dark forest paths. It would disappear with sunrise but return again, hovering on our path. Some nights the sky wept stars that quickly floated and disappeared into the darkness before our wishes could meet them. Under these stars, I used to hear stories, but now it seemed as if it was the sky that was telling us a story as its stars fell, violently colliding with each other.

Memories I sometimes wish I could wash away, even though I am aware that they are an important part of what my life is; who I am now. I stayed up all night, anxiously waiting for daylight, so that I could fully return to my new life, to rediscover happiness I had known as a child, the joy that had stayed alive inside me even through times when being alive itself became a burden.

“One man carried his dead son. He thought the boy was still alive.

I was just living with one, mine, and it was difficult, as the nightmares about what had happened continued to torment me. Why does she do it? Why do they all do it? I thought as we went our separate ways. It was the last time I saw her. I loved her but never told her” – Ishmael Beah
“I will not be alive to see the end of this war. So, to save a place in your memories for other things, I won’t tell you my name. If you survive this war, just remember me as the old man you met. You boys should be on your way” – Ishmael Beah
“Every time people come at us with the intention of killing us, I close my eyes and wait for death. Even though I am still alive, I feel like each time I accept death, part of me dies. Very soon I will completely die and all that will be left is my empty body walking with you. It will be quieter than I am” – Ishmael Beah
“For those who have no voice, silence remains the unbroken truth. And every so often, that silence is torn by a roaring.- Mende Proverb, Sierra Leone” – Ishmael Beah

“Because Inky is right, football has a direct correlation to life, and that’s one of the many reasons I love it so much. And the failure to understand that is why so many people just don’t get how we can become so “obsessed” over a “game” – Inky Johnson

“Seattle gives you your breath back. Fills your lungs. I take it in and feel like I can breathe for the first time in my life” – Tarryn Fisher
“That’s easy to say until the person you love is happy with someone else. Girls always choose men, and men always choose the wrong girls. It’s an endless cycle” – Tarryn Fisher

“I read about them online after Googling: What the fuck is wrong with me? The website was a dot-org so I know it is legit” – Tarryn Fisher
“I feel so pouty. I am just a muggle. A beige bitch muggle. It’s a sad day in Helena Land” – Tarryn Fisher
“My mother hasn’t been speaking to me. She wanted me to forgive Neil, which was fine. There was room in my heart for forgiveness; there wasn’t room in my life for someone who constantly needed it” – Tarryn Fisher

“Let people feel the weight of who you really are, and let them fucking deal with it” – Tarryn Fisher
“You shouldn’t have to convince anyone to choose you. There is no real choice in love” – Tarryn Fisher
“This is something I’ve learned. You can’t run away to find yourself. Yourself is there no matter where you go” – Tarryn Fisher
“The best kind of love is the love that isn’t supposed to happen” – Tarryn Fisher
“There is the only war in love,” he says. “If anyone tells you otherwise, they’re lying. The constant fight to keep love relevant, while growing and changing as a human, is the battle. You fight for them, fight to keep them, fight to love them. Do you fight for yourself, or do you fight for the relationship? What can’t you live without? There’s your answer” – Tarryn Fisher
“That’s the worst thing about being young. You really have no clue about all the changes that are coming. And when they come, no matter how people have warned you, you are genuinely surprised” – Tarryn Fisher
“I think it’s hard for you to fall in love because you like control, and you can’t control what another person does or feels, so you keep all your cards” – Tarryn Fisher
“We think we can control our lives, but our lives control us. And everything that touches our lives controls us. People have less power than they think they do. It’s just the reactions we control” – Tarryn Fisher
“You’re a dead language, you know that? No one is like you, and you are like no one” – Tarryn Fisher

“Nothing worth finding is actually easy to find” – Tarryn Fisher
“Art is the war against what we do not choose to feel. It’s the battle of color, words, sound, and shape, and it rages for or against love” – Tarryn Fisher
“Life is but a carousel of four seasons. Unpredictable for the most part. Happy. Unhappy. Content. Searching. Mess up the order, and they still rebound at one point or another. I’ve learned that revolution can be inward or outward. A move across the country to gain perspective. A change of heart and mind to gain sanity. But the point is to revolt when the season changes. If only to quench your thirst, revolt” – Tarryn Fisher
“You’re just raw, and yourself, and beautiful. You don’t need anything from anyone unless it’s the kind of love that chooses you first, always” – Tarryn Fisher

“Trying to walk away from something you love is like trying to drown yourself. You want to, but it’s unnatural to not crave air” – Tarryn Fisher

“It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever experienced, but that doesn’t mean I don’t feel it anyway” – Tarryn Fisher
“Ten minutes for what? You’re sweating,” I say. “Did you take something, are you on the crack?” What type of drugs make you sweat like that? Crack? Heroine?” – Tarryn Fisher
“Because you might not like what you find” – Tarryn Fisher
“When I felt anxious or lost I would pull it out and touch all of my socks. All loners. All waiting to be reunited with their twin. I eventually outgrow the shoebox … and by that I mean there were too many socks” – Tarryn Fisher
“It’s considered blasphemy in Washington to not enjoy the rainless summer while you have it” – Tarryn Fisher

“You have cheese in your hair,” Kit says. “Right there.” He motions to the spot. I don’t pull it out. Let the cheese have my hair” – Tarryn Fisher
“And, as I get to the airport, I realize that I’m a runner. Life gets hot and I pack my things and leave. It’s new, but so is being an adult. I’m learning about myself. But, hey! I did what I came to do. So I’m an accomplished runner. Greer” – Tarryn Fisher
“She’s always made me feel small, and I’m tired of it. She doesn’t look at me. No one wants to look at me. That’s how the truth works. If you avoid looking at it, you can pretend it’s not there” – Tarryn Fisher
“How come Justin Bieber never gets any better at being a thug?” – Tarryn Fisher
“You can’t run away to find yourself. Yourself is there no matter where you go” – Tarryn Fisher
“We are at that age that balances between independence and conferring with your friends about every minuscule decision you make. I’ve never liked that part of adolescence” – Tarryn Fisher

“Hoes before bros!” I yell at the phone. But it’s too late. A bro came, and both the hos are in turmoil” – Tarryn Fisher
“I was just a flat line until he came along. And maybe now I’m hurting. But isn’t that what love is supposed to do? Make you feel, make you brave, make you look at yourself more carefully?” – Tarryn Fisher
“I’m in an emotional purgatory, the up and the down, the right and the wrong. I’m trying, I’m trying, I’m trying not to… touch him” – Tarryn Fisher
“But perhaps art isn’t supposed to make you feel good, but just to make you feel. Does it cure the numb? I don’t know” – Tarryn Fisher

“I have a disease called can’t keep your fucking mouth shut” – Tarryn Fisher
“So much for the right books; the right use of them is another matter. The children must enjoy the book. The ideas it holds must each make that sudden, delightful impact upon their minds, must cause that intellectual stir, which marks the inception of an idea” – Charlotte Mason
“Look on education as something between the child’s soul and God. Modern Education tends to look at it as something between the child’s brain and the standardized test” – Charlotte Mason
“Every walk should offer some knotty problem for the children to think out-“Why does that leaf float on the water, and this pebble sink?” and so on” – Charlotte Mason
“The people themselves begin to clamor for an education which shall qualify their children for life rather than for earning a living. As a matter of fact, it is the man who has read and thought on many subjects who is, with the necessary training, the most capable whether in handling tools, drawing plans, or keeping books” – Charlotte Mason
“Every common miracle which the child sees with his own eyes makes of him for the moment another Newton” – Charlotte Mason
“Education is a matter of spirit. No wiser word has been said on the subject, and yet we persist in applying education from without. No one knoweth the things of the man except the spirit of man which is in him; therefore, there is no education but self-education, and as soon as a young child begins his education, he does so as a student. Our business is to give him mind-stuff. Both quantity and quality are essential” – Charlotte Mason
“Every day, every hour, the parents are either passively or actively forming those habits in their children upon which, more than upon anything else, future character and conduct depend” – Charlotte Mason
“A child is a person in whom all possibilities are present – present now at this very moment – not to be reduced after many years and efforts manifold on the part of the educator” – Charlotte Mason
“The mother who takes pains to endow her children with good habits secures for herself smooth and easy days” – Charlotte Mason
“Our aim in education is to give a full life. We owe it to them to initiate an immense number of interests. Life should be all living, and not merely a tedious passing of time; not all doing or all feeling or all thinking – the strain would be too great – but, all living; that is to say, we should be in touch wherever we go, whatever we hear, whatever we see, with some manner of vital interest” – Charlotte Mason
“Do not let the endless succession of small things crowd great ideals out of sight and out of mind” – Charlotte Mason
“The teacher who allows his scholars the freedom of the city of books is at liberty to be their guide, philosopher and friend; and is no longer the mere instrument of forcible intellectual feeding” – Charlotte Mason
“As for literature – to introduce children to literature is to install them in a very rich and glorious kingdom, to bring a continual holiday to their doors, to lay before them a feast exquisitely served. But they must learn to know literature by being familiar with it from the very first. A child’s intercourse must always be with good books, the best that we can find” – Charlotte Mason
“Never be within doors when you can rightly be without” – Charlotte Mason
“Imagination does not stir at the suggestion of the feeble, much-diluted stuff that is too often put into children’s hands” – Charlotte Mason
“We are all meant to be naturalists, each in his own degree, and it is inexcusable to live in a world so full of the marvels of plant and animal life and to care for none of these things” – Charlotte Mason
“Of all the joyous motives of school life, the love of knowledge is the only abiding one; the only one which determines the scale, so to speak, upon which the person will hereafter live” – Charlotte Mason
“Authority is just and faithful in all matters of promise-keeping; it is also considerate, and that is why a good mother is the best home-ruler” – Charlotte Mason
“To introduce children to literature is to install them in a very rich and glorious kingdom, to bring a continual holiday to their doors, to lay before them a feast exquisitely served. But they must learn to know literature by being familiar with it from the very first. A child’s intercourse must always be with good books, the best that we can find” – Charlotte Mason
“The most common and the monstrous defect in the education of the day is that children fail to acquire the habit of reading” – Charlotte Mason
“Education is an atmosphere, a discipline, a life” – Charlotte Mason
“Education, like faith, is the evidence of things not seen” – Charlotte Mason
“Give your child a single valuable idea, and you have done more for his education than if you had laid upon his mind the burden of bushels of information” – Charlotte Mason
“The indwelling of Christ is thought particularly fit for the children because their large faith does not stumble at the mystery, their imagination leaps readily to the marvel, that the King Himself should inhabit a little child’s heart” – Charlotte Mason
“Let children feed on the good, the excellent, the great! Don’t get in their way with little lectures, facts, and guided tours!” – Charlotte Mason
“We talk of lost ideals, but perhaps they are not lost, only changed; when our ideal for ourselves and for our children becomes limited to prosperity and comfort, we get these, very likely, for ourselves and for them, but we get no more” – Charlotte Mason
“The children’s lessons should provide material for their mental growth, should exercise the several powers of their minds, should furnish them with fruitful ideas, and should afford them knowledge, really valuable for its own sake, accurate, and interesting, of the kind that the child may recall as a man with profit and pleasure” – Charlotte Mason
“For the mind is capable of dealing with only one kind of food; it lives, grows and is nourished upon ideas only; mere information is to it as a meal of sawdust to the body; there are no organs for the assimilation of the one more than of the other” – Charlotte Mason
“Every person exceeds our power of measurement” – Charlotte Mason
“Thought breeds thought; children familiar with great thoughts take as naturally to thinking for themselves as the well-nourished body takes to growing; and we must bear in mind that growth, physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual, is the sole end of education” – Charlotte Mason
“Of the three sorts of knowledge proper to a child, the knowledge of God, of man, and of the universe,–the knowledge of God ranks first in importance, is indispensable, and most happy-making” – Charlotte Mason
“The mother who takes pains to endow her children with good habits secures for herself smooth and easy days” – Charlotte Mason
“What a child digs for becomes his own possession” – Charlotte Mason
“We attempt to define a person, the most commonplace person we know, but he will not submit to bounds; some unexpected beauty of nature breaks out; we find he is not what we thought, and begin to suspect that every person exceeds our power of measurement” – Charlotte Mason
“We do not merely give a religious education because that would seem to imply the possibility of some other education, a secular education, for example. But we hold that all education is divine, that every good gift of knowledge and insight comes from above, that the Lord the Holy Spirit is the supreme educator of mankind, and that the culmination of all education (which may at the same time be reached by a little child) is that personal knowledge of and intimacy with God in which our being finds its fullest perfection” – Charlotte Mason
“Therefore, teaching, talk, and tale, however lucid or fascinating, effect nothing until self-activity be set up; that is, self-education is the only possible education; the rest is mere veneer laid on the surface of a child’s nature” – Charlotte Mason
“There is no education but self-education” – Charlotte Mason
“None of us can be proof against the influences that proceed from the persons he associates with. Wherefore, in books and men, let us lookout for the best society, that which yields a bracing and wholesome influence. We all know the person for whose company we are the better, though the talk is only about fishing or embroidery” – Charlotte Mason
“In this time of extraordinary pressure, educational and social, perhaps a mother’s first duty to her children is to secure for them a quiet and growing time, a full six years of passive receptive life, the waking part of it, for the most part, spent out in the fresh air” – Charlotte Mason
“Profound thought is conveyed in the language of very great simplicity and purity” – Charlotte Mason
“I think we owe it to children to let them dig their knowledge, of whatever subject, for themselves out of the “fit” book; and this for two reasons: What a child digs for is his own possession; what is poured into his ear, like the idle song of a pleasant singer, floats out as lightly as it came in, and is rarely assimilated. I do not mean to say that the lecture and the oral lesson are without their uses; but these uses are, to give impulse and to order knowledge; and not to convey knowledge” – Charlotte Mason
“The peculiar value of geography lies in its fitness to nourish the mind with ideas and furnish the imagination with pictures” – Charlotte Mason
“Education is the science of relations” – Charlotte Mason
“We all have need to be trained to see, and to have our eyes opened before we can take in the joy that is meant for us in this beautiful life” – Charlotte Mason
“Education is a life; that life is sustained on ideas; ideas are of spiritual origin, and that we get them chiefly as we convey them to one another. The duty of parents is to sustain a child’s inner life with ideas as they sustain his body with food” – Charlotte Mason
“Composition is as natural as jumping and running to children who have been allowed due use of books” – Charlotte Mason
“Wise and purposeful letting alone is the best part of education” – Charlotte Mason
“The problem before the educator is to give the child control over his own nature, to enable him to hold himself in hand as much in regard to the traits we call good, as to those we call evil” – Charlotte Mason
“We have never been so rich in books. But there has never been a generation when there is so much twaddle in print for children” – Charlotte Mason
“Children should have the joy of living in far lands, in other persons, in other times – a delightful double existence; and this joy they will find, for the most part, in their storybooks. Their lessons, too, history and geography, should cultivate their conceptive powers. If the children do not live in the times of his history lesson, be not at home in the climate his geography book describes, why, these lessons will fail of their purpose” – Charlotte Mason
“Children should transcribe favorite passages. –A certain sense of possession and delight may be added to this exercise if children are allowed to choose for transcription their favorite verse in one poem or another… But a book of their own, made up of their own chosen verses, should give them pleasure” – Charlotte Mason
“An observant child should be put in the way of things worth observing” – Charlotte Mason
“Let children alone… the education of habit is successful in so far as it enables the mother to let her children alone, not teasing them with perpetual commands and directions – a running fire of Do and Don’t; but letting them go their own way and grow, having first secured that they will go the right way and grow to fruitful purpose” – Charlotte Mason
“Let children have tales of the imagination, scenes laid in other lands and other times; heroic adventures, hairbreadth escapes, delicious fairy tales, even where it is all impossible, and they know it, and yet they believe” – Charlotte Mason
“A child gets moral notions from the fairy-tales he delights in, as do his elders from tale and verse” – Charlotte Mason
“I’ll flatten you like a pancake — turn back!” – Leo Tolstoy

“The whole world is divided for me into two parts: one is she, and there is all happiness, hope, light; the other is where she is not, and there everything is dejection and darkness…” – Leo Tolstoy
“Since the day his wife arrived in Moscow, Pierre had been intending to go somewhere, only so as not to be there with her” – Leo Tolstoy
“There are two sides to each man’s life: his personal life, which is the freer the more abstract its interests, and his elemental, swarm-like life, where man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him” – Leo Tolstoy
“Man lives consciously for himself, but serves as an unconscious instrument for the achievement of historical, universally human goals” – Leo Tolstoy
“Natasha walked in her violet dress with black lace as women know how to walk — the more calmly and majestically, the more pained and ashamed she felt at heart” – Leo Tolstoy

“To study the laws of history, we must change completely the object of observation, leave kings, ministers, and generals alone, and study the uniform, infinitesimal elements that govern the masses” – Leo Tolstoy
“Yes, death is an awakening” – Leo Tolstoy
“When a man sees a dying animal, horror comes over him: that which he himself is, his essence, is obviously being annihilated before his eyes — is ceasing to be” – Leo Tolstoy
“I don’t know since when I’ve loved her. But I’ve loved only her, her alone, all my life, and I love her so much that I can’t imagine my life without her” – Leo Tolstoy
“He was putting together, as he said, a serious library, and made it a rule to read all the books he bought” – Leo Tolstoy
“Not dear for being pretty, but pretty for being dear. Men only love Malvina and the like because they’re beautiful: but do I love my wife? It’s not loving, but just…I don’t know how to tell you. Without you, or like today, when there’s some falling-out between us, it’s as if I’m lost and can’t do anything. Well, do I love my finger? I don’t love it, but try cutting it off…” – Leo Tolstoy
“Kings are the slaves of history” – Leo Tolstoy
“God is the same everywhere” – Leo Tolstoy
“What is War and Peace? It is not a novel, still less an epic poem, still less a historical chronicle. War and Peace is what the author wanted and was able to express, in the form in which it is expressed” – Leo Tolstoy

“We are asleep until we fall in Love!” – Leo Tolstoy
“I simply want to live; to cause no evil to anyone but myself” – Leo Tolstoy
“I don’t know what will happen then, I don’t want to know and I can’t know; but if I want this, want glory, want to be known to people, want to be loved by them, it’s not my fault that I want it, that it’s the only thing I want, the only thing I live for. Yes, the only thing! I’ll never tell it to anyone, but my God! what am I to do if I love nothing except glory, except people’s love? Death, wounds, loss of family, nothing frightens me. And however near and dear many people are to me — my father, my sister, my wife — the dearest people to me — but, however terrible and unnatural it seems, I’d give them all now for a moment of glory, of triumph over people, for love from people I don’t know and will never know, for the love of these people here” – Leo Tolstoy
“Because of the self-confidence with which he had spoken, no one could tell whether what he said was very clever or very stupid” – Leo Tolstoy
“Man cannot possess anything as long as he fears death. But to him who does not fear it, everything belongs. If there was no suffering, man would not know his limits, would not know himself” – Leo Tolstoy
“How can one be well…when one suffers morally?” – Leo Tolstoy

And it is very odd by those who see the changes–who dream, who will not give up–are called idealists…and those who see only the circle we call them the ‘realists’!” – Lorraine Hansberry
“Mama–Mama–I want so many things… I want so many things that they are driving me kind of crazy…” – Lorraine Hansberry
“That’s what being eccentric means–being natural” – Lorraine Hansberry
“Mama, you don’t understand. It’s all a matter of ideas, and God is just one idea I don’t accept. It’s not important. I am not going out and committing crimes or being immoral because I don’t believe in God. I don’t even think about it. It’s just that I get so tired of Him getting credit for all the things the human race achieves through its own stubborn effort. There simply is no God! There is only Man, and it’s he who makes miracles!” – Lorraine Hansberry

“MAMA (Quietly, woman to woman)… He finally came into his manhood today, didn’t he? Kind of like a rainbow after the rain…
“You aimin’ to go the full circle now? How long before I have to come get you up from the sidewalks? You got hurt and pain in you? Well, I used to know a man who knew how to live with his pain and make his hurt work for him. Your daddy died with dignity; there wasn’t no bum in him. And he knows some hurts in this life you ain’t never even heard of!” – Lorraine Hansberry
“For above all, in behalf of an ailing world which sorely needs our defiance, may we, as Negroes or women, never accept the notion of – “our place” – Lorraine Hansberry
“Then isn’t this rather all a false funeral? Can’t it help you to see that there is something wrong when all the dreams in this house-good or bad-had to depend on something that might never have happened if a man had not died? We always say at home: Accident was at the first and will be at the last a poor tree from which the fruits of life may bloom” – Lorraine Hansberry
“You don’t have to go to the kings and queens of the earth – I think the Greeks and Elizabethans did this because it was a logical concept – but every human being is in enormous conflict about something, even if it’s how to get to work in the morning and all of that” – Lorraine Hansberry
“I think it is about time that equipped women began to take on some of the ethical questions which a male-dominated culture has produced and dissect and analyze them quite to pieces in a serious fashion.

“The whole realm of morality and ethics is something that has escaped the attention of women, by and large. And it needs the attention of intellectual women most desperately” – Lorraine Hansberry

You’re on a journey with no defined beginning, middle or end. There are no wrong twists and turns. There is just being. And your job is to be as you as you can be. This is why you’re here. To shy away from who you truly are would leave the world you-less. You are the only you there is and ever will be. I repeat, you are the only you there is and ever will be. Do not deny the world its one and only chance to bask in your brilliance” – Jen Sincero
“You are loved. Massively. Ferociously. Unconditionally. The Universe is totally freaking out about how awesome you are. It’s got you wrapped in a warm gorilla hug of adoration.

“What other people think about you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them” – Jen Sincero

“Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” – Tim Tebow
“You’re going to have injuries, danger, and glory in every sport. What makes football unique is that every person on that team needs to count on everybody else.

“Success comes in a lot of ways, but it doesn’t come with money and it doesn’t come with fame. It comes from having meaning in your life, doing what you love, and being passionate about what you do.

“As a competitor and an athlete, you have to believe in yourself.  And you have to believe in the people who believe in you” – Tim Tebow

“Don’t worry about what you can’t control” – Tim Tebow
“When you die there’s going to be a tombstone. It’s going to have your name. It’s gonna have the year you’re born and the day you die. In between, there’s going to be a dash.

“For me, my goal is to be able to impact as many people as possible for something good, for something right; to be able to leave a legacy of something bigger than myself – not for winning games, not for scoring touchdowns, but that Jesus Christ has changed my life. You can love God, and you can love people. There’s more to this world than money, fame, and power. You can have an impact, no matter who you are; no matter what platform.

It’s not mine. You might lend it to me for a little while. You might let me hold onto it. You might let me use it for a little bit, but that’s not mine; it’s yours. Thank you for letting me use that for a little while. I think that’s what staying grounded means” – Tim Tebow 
“On the field, I’m trying to play for the glory of God but then also I’m trying to give everything I have and win and compete. And so I think more than just winning or losing, I think He cares about where our hearts are when we’re playing” – Tim Tebow
“Regardless of what happens, I still honor my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, because, at the end of the day, that’s what’s important, win, or lose. … We need to get back to one nation under God and be role models for kids” – Tim Tebow“People often seem to think that when you’re following the Lord and trying to do His will, your path will always be clear, the decisions smooth and easy, and life will be lived happily ever after and all that. Sometimes that may be true, but I’ve found that more often, it’s not. The muddled decisions still seem muddled, bad things still happen to believers, and great things can happen to nonbelievers. When it comes to making our decisions, the key that God is concerned with is that we are trusting and seeking Him. God’s desire is for us to align our lives with His Word and His will” – Tim Tebow  
“It’s pretty easy for me to say that the most important thing in my life is my relationship with Jesus Christ, followed by my relationship with the family. And football’s later on down the line” – Tim Tebow“We all know of people who thought they could to it (whatever “it” is) tomorrow. We have all procrastinated on such a way, and often to our personal regret. It happens time and again, putting off things that we convince ourselves might be better, more meaningful, more appropriate for another time. So often that better time either never comes or really isn’t better or more appropriate after all. And then, sadly, the window of opportunity -to do something great- closes” – Tim Tebow
“Don’t be normal. Be an example” – Tim Tebow
“If I didn’t work as hard as I could, then I think it would be a bit like saying, ‘God, thanks for giving me this ability, but I don’t really care about it. I’m going to do something else, and I’m not going to work quite as hard” – Tim Tebow
“We were created by Love, in love, and for love” – Tim Tebow

“Can the purpose of a relationship be to trigger our wounds? In a way, yes, because that is how healing happens; darkness must be exposed before it can be transformed. The purpose of an intimate relationship is not that it be a place where we can hide from our weaknesses, but rather where we can safely let them go. It takes strength of character to truly delve into the mystery of an intimate relationship because it takes the strength to endure a kind of psychic surgery, an emotional and psychological, and even spiritual initiation into the higher Self. Only then can we know an enchantment that lasts” – Marianne Williamson

“Intimacy is not something that just happens between two people; it is a way of being alive. At every moment, we are choosing either to reveal ourselves or to protect ourselves, to value ourselves, or to diminish ourselves, to tell the truth, or to hide. To dive into life or to avoid it. Intimacy is making the choice to be connected to, rather than isolated from, our deepest truth at that moment” – Geneen Roth
“It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others” – Jane Austen
“If you love a person and live the whole life with him or with her, a great intimacy will grow and love will have deeper and deeper revelations to make to you. It is not possible if you go on changing partners very often. It is as if you go on changing a tree from one place to another, then another; then it never grows roots anywhere. To grow roots, a tree needs to remain in one place. Then it goes deeper; then it becomes stronger. Intimacy is good, and to remain in one commitment is beautiful, but the basic necessity is love. If a tree is rooted in a place where there are only rocks and they are killing the tree, then it is better to remove it. Then don’t insist that it should remain in one place. Remain true to life – remove the tree, because now it is going against life” – Osho

“The real heroes anyway aren’t the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention” – John Green
“True intimacy is a human constant. People of all types find it equally hard to achieve, equally precious to hold. Age, education, social status, make little difference here; even genius does not presuppose the talent to reveal one’s self completely and completely absorb one’s self in another personality. Intimacy is to love what concentration is to work: a simultaneous drawing together to attention and release of energy” – Robert Grudin
“It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being” – John Joseph Powell
“Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they’re not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or-such is the pleasure they experience-they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them” – Paulo Coelho
“I taste him, and I realize I have been starving” – Jodi Picoult

“I feel like we’re all here on this planet, and intimacy is important. I can’t bear small talk. It’s awful. I want to get beyond that thing of discussing how the weather is a bit better today than it was yesterday, and how this is a nice restaurant. I want to get to what are the problems, what’s really going on. Are you in love? Are you in a lot of pain? What’s really going on in your life? I’m interested in that area, whether it’s on stage or in real life” – Thomas Moore

“The highest form of love is the love that allows for intimacy without the annihilation of difference” – Parker J. Palmer
“Many people are desperate to find a soul mate, someone who responds to their deep image of love and intimacy.  They go to great lengths to meet people, and they spend considerable time feeling achingly deprived of the joys of intimacy they imagine.  Their attitude is summed up in the frequent lament: When am I going to find the person who is right for me?  This approach to love seems to reflect the narcissism of the times.  When am I going to get what I need for my growth and my satisfaction? An alternative would be to give all that attention either to one’s own life – developing one’s talents, educating oneself in culture, and simply becoming an interesting person – or to a needy society.  This crafting of life is a positive way of preparing oneself for intimacy” – Thomas Moore
“Physical intimacy isn’t and can never be an effective substitute for emotional intimacy” – John Green

“Men may feel just disempowered by intimacy, by being close to a woman, and also by feeling the tender feelings that they’re ashamed of” – Gloria Steinem

“Because that’s what intimacy is: It’s a willingness to be vulnerable, a willingness to bite my tongue and a willingness to set an example of what I believe in” – Diane Lane
“I don’t have any fear of intimacy, but rather thrive on it, which is rare in a public person” – Jack Nicholson
“Prenups are so unromantic – a sign of distrust, not love. Time for a reality check, my friends. First, drawing up a prenuptial agreement together is a sign of incredible trust and financial openness – you’re fooling yourself if you think you can achieve complete intimacy without it” – Suze Orman

“Intimacy comes from being yourself on the stage and making the audience feel, without trying, that you’re sittin’ down there with ’em, playing, and that can happen in a big hall if you have a good audience that wants to listen” – Doc Watson
“Globalisation has obliterated distance, not just physically but also, most dangerously, mentally. It creates the illusion of intimacy when, in fact, the mental distances have changed little. It has concertinaed the world without engendering the necessary respect, recognition, and tolerance that must accompany it” – Martin Jacques

And sometimes I worry about drying out, and dying” – Walter Payton“I developed my training routine going into my senior year at Jackson State. I found this sandbank by the Pearl River near my hometown, Columbia, Miss. I laid out a course of 65 yards or so. Sixty-five yards on sand is like 120 on turf, but running on sand helps you make your cuts at full speed” – Walter Payton“A lot of fans were drawn to me because they knew that whatever the score was, I was going to run as hard as I could on every play.
